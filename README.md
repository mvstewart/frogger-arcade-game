//Instructions on how to load and play the game
When the screen loads, the game starts. Use arrow keys to navigate the player to the water blocks. Each time your reach water, you gain 50 points. Stay away from bugs. Each time you hit a bug, you lose 10 points and you lose 1 life.
After you lose all 3 lives, the game is over. The game will record your high score, if you hit restart button. Also, when you hit restart button, the game starts again.
